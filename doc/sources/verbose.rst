############
Verbose Mode
############

Use |sklearnex| in verbose mode to find out which implementation of the algorithm is currently used,
|sklearnex| or original Scikit-learn.

.. note:: Verbose mode is only available for :ref:`supported algorithms <sklearn_algorithms>`.

To enable verbose mode, set the ``SKLEARNEX_VERBOSE`` environment variable as shown below:

- On Linux* OS ::

     export SKLEARNEX_VERBOSE=INFO

- On Windows* OS ::

     set SKLEARNEX_VERBOSE=INFO

Alternatively, get |sklearnex| logger and set its logging level in the Python code::

     import logging
     logger = logging.getLogger('sklearnex')
     logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

During the calls that use Intel-optimized scikit-learn, you will receive additional print statements
that indicate which implementation is being called.
These print statements are only available for :ref:`supported algorithms <sklearn_algorithms>`.

For example, for DBSCAN you get one of these print statements depending on which implementation is used::

    INFO:sklearnex: sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.fit: running accelerated version on CPU

::

    INFO:sklearnex: sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.fit: fallback to original Scikit-learn
